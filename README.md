I read as much `.md` as all other programming languages combined.

Personal notes, research notes, Claude Code generated reports, random READMEs.

I find it easier to read rich, block-based markdown than raw markdown — WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), so the document on screen already looks the way it will read.

That's why Prosedown exists.

## The Cool Stuff

### Rich Diffs — for git _and_ AI edits

You have seen rich editing. But have you seen rich **diffing**?

Prosedown renders a navigable, side-by-side diff of your markdown — with images inline and headings intact. It works for `git` changes **and** for AI-proposed edits: when Claude Code (or another agent) previews a change to a `.md` file, Prosedown opens the rich diff automatically. Step through every change with the ↑ / ↓ controls.

### Seamless Sync.

Open in the Default Editor.

Open in the Rich Editor.

Open in the Browser.

It just works.

### Navigate without hassle.

Sticky headings so you can navigate long documents with ease.

Table of contents so you know where you are.

Clicky here, go there.

## Loaded With Features

### Modes

#### Default Editor

Default editor supports opening in Rich Editor and Browser modes.

Enjoy it because this will be the last time you open the vanilla view.

#### Rich Editor

The rich editor lets you jump straight back to the default editor, or open in the browser. Everything syncs automatically and instantly.

![rich-editor-overview](assets/rich-editor-overview.png)

#### Browser

Browser mode lets you open the rich editor as a Chrome/Firefox tab, so you can take it with you everywhere your browser goes.

Drag and drop images, gifs, etc.

It's like Notion, but you own the data.

### Rich editing

#### Slash Commands

The beloved `/` works out of the box. It's like you never left your favourite editor.

![slash-command-working](assets/slash-command-working.png)

#### Checkboxes, Tables, Math, Quotes, Code Blocks, and your standard stuff.

Tables have options to:

- add row above, add row below
- add column to the left, add columns to the right
- remove rows, remove columns
- drop the entire table

You can write math using $\KaTeX$ in both inline and block modes.

#### Mermaid Diagrams

` ```mermaid ` fences render as live diagrams inline — edit the source, the preview updates.

#### YouTube & GitHub Embeds

Paste a YouTube or GitHub URL and get a rich card; the source stays a bare URL so the file remains portable.

## Known Limitations

- Conversion from markdown to rich text and back to markdown is not one-to-one exact map. The markdown after is normalized. You can control this to some extent via the settings icon in the rich editor mode.
- Bold/italic adjacent to a word, when the run also contains a code span, can't be expressed in plain CommonMark (e.g. `**`bold`**Apples` parses as literal asterisks, not bold). The editor saves these as `**`bold`**<!---->Apples` — an empty HTML comment is the cleanest CommonMark-valid way to break the flanking run so the bold survives re-open. Adding a space (or any non-word char) avoids the separator entirely and is handled naturally.

### Privacy

I do not collect telemetry, analytics, or usage data.

I am too lazy to implement that.

Everything runs locally in your VS Code instance.
